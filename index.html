          <p class=text> Dalton Mooring is a classical tenor trombonist and physics student currently attending the University of Ottawa, Canada. Expected to graduate in 2021, he is working towards a degree in trombone performance and an honors degree in physics.  After graduating Dalton will look to perform with various musical ensembles and do research into topics related to quantum physics and particle physics.<br>
            When he is not practicing orchestral excerpts and pondering why quantum chromodynamics does not seemingly break charge parity symmetry principles he is looking up new vegan recipes, running or playing video games with his friends.<br><br>

            <p class="text">Dalton has been playing trombone since the fourth grade.   He has received numerous awards for solo as well as ensemble performance.  Click here to view a full music résumé.  He has a background playing in many different larger ensembles including drum corps, wind ensembles, symphonic orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, traditional modern jazz bands and even an early jazz orchestra (songs before 1940).  In addition he has played in smaller groups such as pit bands for musicals, brass quintets, low brass ensembles, piano duets and jazz combos.<br>
              Dalton has also been exposed to the another side of music, often taking the role as principle, first chair, section leader which has granted him valuable time to grow as a leader and pass his skills on to others. In addition to being a group leader Dalton enjoys composing original pieces, arranging pieces for both small and large groups and sometimes teaching and conducting these pieces for performance in concert.<br>
              Currently Dalton is a member of several performing ensembles at the University of Ottawa including the wind ensemble and orchestra.  He is under the guidance of Eastman graduate <a href="https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/douglas-burden" title="Douglas Burden">Douglas Burden</a> as well McGill University graduate <a href="https://nac-cna.ca/en/bio/donald-renshaw" title="Donald Renshaw"> Donald Renshaw</a>.<br>

                Throughout his high school and college Dalton has become proficient in several coding languages including C++, Python, and Java.  He also has experience designing and maintaining various webpages (including this one) from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Dalton is also familiar with many tools that are commonplace in the current computer science field such as SQL, Node.js, and Swift.<br>
                In Python he has done numerous exercises and personable projects (link coming soon) in Deep Learning, Machine Learning and manipulating Big Data using libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow and PyTorch.<br>
                Through hundreds of hours of coding and research Dalton has concluded that Atom is the best text editor.
